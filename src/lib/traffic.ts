/**
 * src/lib/traffic.ts
 *
 * Traffic interpolation utilities.
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS:
 * A traffic pattern is defined as a sparse list of { atSecond, rps } points.
 * The engine needs to know the exact rps at every single second.
 * This file provides the interpolation logic that fills in the gaps.
 *
 * Example:
 *   pattern = [{ atSecond: 0, rps: 100 }, { atSecond: 10, rps: 1000 }]
 *   getRpsAtSecond(pattern, 5) -> 550 (linear interpolation midpoint)
 *
 * Pure TypeScript. No React. No side effects.
